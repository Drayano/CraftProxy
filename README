To start use:

java -jar CraftProxy.jar <port to bind to> <default server> <default port> [<password>] [verbose]

If your server is on the same server as the proxy and uses port 25565, you could use

java -jar CraftProxy.jar 20000 localhost 25565 somepassword

Players would connect using yourhostname.com:20000
